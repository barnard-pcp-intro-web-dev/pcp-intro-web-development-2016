##0.2 Syllabus and Setting up your work station

- Verify you computer has a modern web browser. I *highly* recommend using the latest version of Chrome
- Decide on a note-taking/journaling format. You are going to be learning a lot of information, and you will need a place to store it. You can use a physical notebook, a Google doc, Evernote. Do what works for you, but make sure you have a place to store your notes, questions, and reflections
