##<a id="directions">Final Project directions</a>

- Step 1: Choose a project: You have wide latitude in the type of website you build. Your website must include at least 4 pages, media, and use modern, valid HTML and CSS. You may choose to use a framework if you like. Some example frameworks include Bootstrap, Foundation, or Skeleton. If you’re not sure what to build, how about: 
	- A website for an organization, real or fictitious
	- A website for a person, real, historical, or fictitious
	- A website for an event or a cause
	- Redesign an existing website (for example, can you make a better yelp? This guy prototyped one)

- Step 2: Create wireframes
	- Watch: What is a Wireframe?
	- Read: The 5 Steps of a Professional UX Design Process
	- Prepare your wireframes - paper is perfectly fine or you can use an online tool like Google Docs, Google Slides, or an official wireframing tool like balsamiq (don’t buy it, just use free trial!). I suggest you start out wireframing just 4 pages. You can always expand your site later, but start small. 

- Step 3: Start Building! - Set up your pages 
	- Set up a local project directory, and make sure you put it under version control with git
	- Set up the shell of your HTML and CSS pages 
	- Push to github

** When you are done with the above, [submit the homework]()** 

- Step 4: Keep Building!
	- Continue building out your pages

- Step 5: Validate
	- Run your HTML pages through: http://validator.w3.org/
	- Run your CSS page(s) through: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/


- Step 6: Present
	- During the final class on Tues 4/21, you will present your web pages to your peers

##<a id="tips">Tips for the final project</a>
- Wireframe first! 
- Once you have a wireframe, set up your project with git and push to github
- Focus first on the layout of your pages. Add a grid to your CSS, then set up boxes with the right sizes
- Once you have the basic layout, fill in pieces. Start with common pieces like headers and footers 
- You don’t have to use a framework. The best thing a framework gives you is a grid, and responsive layout. If you do decide to use a framework, don’t copy all the CSS code to your project. Instead, add a link to the CSS code hosted on a CD to your HTML doc (in the head). For example:
	- Twitter Bootstrap: http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css
	- Zurb Foundation: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/5.5.1/css/foundation.min.css
