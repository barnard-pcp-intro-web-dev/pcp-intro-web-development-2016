####1.1a: Why Programming?

- Read: [1.1 Why Programming](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AXe2o3v7tBVGNHJbRC2eAEVuL65xvnB4xxNFFgXank8/edit?usp=sharing) 
- Consider this **key takeaway:** While not everyone wants to be or should be a professional software engineer, a basic understanding of computing concepts and how web/mobile applications work is critical for success in a networked world.

##<a id="12-webapps">1.2: How do web apps work?</a>

####1.2a - What Is a Web App?

- Read: [1.2 How web apps work?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H2VA6pImaF_MLvCaAwBuK75GPIr4aI7a56AfbTH8AhE/edit?usp=sharing) 

####1.2b - Not A Series of Tubes

-  Watch: [Not A Series of Tubes](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/the-basics/not-tubes)
- Consider this **key takeaway:** A web application is software that runs in a browser. The “front-end” of the application is the part the user interacts with in the browser and written using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

####1.3a: Tools of the Trade - Text Editors 

- Read slides 1-3: [1.3 Explore HTML/CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LhOGcbd3HCZxw5OBC2fA12s59tIy01rE1vRFzVO7e_o/edit?usp=sharing)
- Install a text editor. I recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

####1.3b: Hack This Page

- Go to [https://goo.gl/s2Wx9G](https://goo.gl/s2Wx9G)
- Download the folder and save it on your desktop
- Attempt to make all the changes listed on slide 4 of [Explore HTML and CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LhOGcbd3HCZxw5OBC2fA12s59tIy01rE1vRFzVO7e_o/edit#slide=id.g6e36b57d0_033)

####1.3c: More Hack This Page

+ Go to [https://goo.gl/mJTlk6](https://goo.gl/mJTlk6)
+ Download the folder and save it on your desktop
+ Attempt to make all the changes listed on page 5 of [Explore HTML and CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LhOGcbd3HCZxw5OBC2fA12s59tIy01rE1vRFzVO7e_o/edit#slide=id.g6e36b57d0_033)

##<a id="14-commandline">1.4. Command Line</a>

####1.4a: The Command Line

- Read: [1.4 The Command Line](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17bnQLSh7gyA7_upkFSQJraF_vccp_AlEtnRpNzZgqJQ/edit#slide=id.p29) 
- Remember these basic commands
	- **pwd** : print working director
	- **cd** : change directory
	- **mkdir** : make directory
	- **open** : open a file
	- **touch** or **New-item** : create a new file
	- **ls** : list all files

####1.4b: Practice the Command Line

Find your shell and practice using the command line - directions below are from slide 6 of [1.4 The Command Line](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17bnQLSh7gyA7_upkFSQJraF_vccp_AlEtnRpNzZgqJQ/edit#slide=id.p29):

> - Create a directory called cli-practice
> - Create a file in the directory called index.html
> - Create another file in the directory called mystyles.css
> - Rename the html file to something else
> - Rename the CSS file to something else

Remember to think of CLI as a mini programming language you need to understand to give your computer instructions.

##<a id="15-dom">1.5. Document Object Model</a>

####1.5a: Tools of the Trade - The Inspector

- Explore the Google homepage using Dev Tools - see slides 1-3 of [1.5 Document Object Model](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LhOGcbd3HCZxw5OBC2fA12s59tIy01rE1vRFzVO7e_o/edit?usp=sharing)

####1.5b: HTML Document Tree

- Learn about the browser DOM tree - directions below are from slide 4 in [1.5 Document Object Model](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LhOGcbd3HCZxw5OBC2fA12s59tIy01rE1vRFzVO7e_o/edit?usp=sharing)

> Let’s explore a page using Dev Tools:

> - Go to: [en.wikipedia.org](en.wikipedia.org)
> - In the Chrome menu, select Tools > Developer Tools 
> - Go to the Elements Tab, and mouse over the lines
> - What do you notice? (Write down all that apply)
> - Everything in the elements tab is visible to the user on the page
> - When you hover over elements on the page, your browser highlights a rectangular area
> - You can see the same text in the elements tab as on the page

####1.5c: Create a DOM tree

- Create a DOM tree describing the structure of [this web page](http://pcpsimpletree.neocities.org/).
