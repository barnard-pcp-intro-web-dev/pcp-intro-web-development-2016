- Check out the most updated syllabus on our course website at [http://pcp-intro-web-dev.herokuapp.com/](http://pcp-intro-web-dev.herokuapp.com/).
- Verify you computer has a modern web browser. I *highly* recommend using the latest version of Chrome
- Decide on a note-taking/journaling format. You are going to be learning a lot of information, and you will need a place to store it. You can use a physical notebook, a Google doc, Evernote. Do what works for you, but make sure you have a place to store your notes, questions, and reflections

- Consider this **key takeaway:** A web application is software that runs in a browser. The “front-end” of the application is the part the user interacts with in the browser and written using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
