####<a id="directions">Final Project directions</a>

#####Step 1

Choose a project: You have wide latitude in the type of website you build. Your website must include at least 4 pages, media, and use modern, valid HTML and CSS. You may choose to use a framework if you like. Some example frameworks include [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), or [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/). If you’re not sure what to build, how about: 
	- A website for an organization, real or fictitious
	- A website for a person, real, historical, or fictitious
	- A website for an event or a cause
	- Redesign an existing website (for example, can you make a better [yelp](http://www.yelp.com/brooklyn)? This guy [prototyped](https://medium.com/@jerrycao_uxpin/the-power-of-minimalism-a-story-of-redesigning-yelp-1a39c0b014f0) one)

#####Step 2: Create wireframes

- Watch: [What is a Wireframe?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0vt3nLZKks)
- Read: T[he 5 Steps of a Professional UX Design Process](http://skillcrush.com/2014/06/24/5-ux-design-deliverables/)
- Prepare your wireframes - paper is perfectly fine or you can use an online tool like Google Docs, Google Slides, or an official wireframing tool like [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) (don’t buy it, just use free trial!). I suggest you start out wireframing just 4 pages. You can always expand your site later, but start small. 

** When you are done with the above, remember to submit it as homework (due July 10th)** 

#####Step 3: Start Building! - Set up your pages 
- Set up a local project directory, and make sure you put it under version control with git
- Set up the shell of your HTML and CSS pages 
- Push to github.  If you need a refresher on getting started with Git, check out [the cheat sheet](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/resources/git-started-cheat-sheet.md) I created

** When you are done with Step 3, remember to submit it as homework (due July 13th)** 

#####Step 4: Keep Building!

- Continue building out your pages
- See [what I will check when evaluating your work](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/units/5-finalproject.md#evaluation).

#####Step 5: Validate
- Run your HTML pages through: http://validator.w3.org/
- Run your CSS page(s) through: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/


#####Step 6: Present

- Host your project on GitHub pages. [This is how you get your site hosted on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/units/4-specialtopics.md#45a-hosting-with-github-pages). - Remember to [submit your project](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/units/5-finalproject.md#final-project-submission-by-thurs-july-16) by 9 AM on 7/16.
- During the final class on Thurs 7/16, you will have 7-10 minutes to present your website to your peers.
- In your presentation, please cover the following--
	- **The purpose of your website**: what did you decide to build?  Why did you decide to build it?  Who would or could find your website useful (i.e. target audience)?
	- **Technologies you used**: what technologies did you use (e.g. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc.) and why? 
	- **Reflection**: what did you learn about HTML, CSS, and responsive design? What did you learn about web development? What would you improve if you had more time?  In hindsight, what might have you done differently?
	- **Struggles/issues**: what struggles and problems did you encounter (technological and/or personal)?
	- **What's next**: In its next iteration, how will/would you make it better?

####<a id="evaluation">In evaluating your work, I will be checking for the following:</a>

- Directory structure: organize your code in a logical structure. Is your code organized in a manner that is logical? You have seen many examples of appropriate directory structures in our work so far. 
- Layout:  Does your website's layout meaningfully improve the appearance and understandability of your content?  Is the website clean with an easy-to-follow navigation system that contributes to a usable webpage layout?  Is the content on the website easy to find? 
- Responsiveness: Is your page optimized for viewing on a smaller screen than our classroom computers (whether the smaller screen be a smaller browser window or, if you want to challenge yourself, another device like a smartphone)?
- Code quality: write valid HTML and CSS. The w3c consortium has an excellent [code validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) which tells you if your html page is valid.  There is also a [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Copy/paste or upload your files to the validator, and fix any errors! 
- Code readability: write code that is readable by using appropriate formatting (e.g., filenames and tags are all lowercase) and appropriate comments where applicable. Udacity has an excellent [style guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) which you should read/use for code readability.
- Presentation: Does your presentation thoughtfully and effectively describe the purpose of your website, the technologies used, reflection and issues, and next steps?

[Here is the rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1umgGoaSNbg2hKaP_QEwuZS0YqTIrzStUVMAvMygDA3g/edit?usp=sharing) on which it will be graded.

####<a id="tips">Tips for the final project</a>
- Wireframe first! 
- Once you have a wireframe, set up your project with git and push to github
- Focus first on the layout of your pages. Perhaps, add a grid to your CSS, then set up boxes with the right sizes
- Once you have the basic layout, fill in pieces. Start with common pieces like headers and footers 
- You don’t have to use a framework. The best thing a framework gives you is a grid, and responsive layout. If you do decide to use a framework, don’t copy all the CSS code to your project. Instead, add a link to the CSS code hosted on a CD to your HTML doc (in the head). For example:
	- Twitter Bootstrap: http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css
	- Zurb Foundation: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/5.5.1/css/foundation.min.css



####<a id="homeworksubmission">Homework Submission (by Friday, July 10th)</a>

Once you are finished with Steps 1-2,  submit your homework. 

Your submission should include:

- Your wireframes - attachments of photos is fine

####<a id="homeworksubmission">Homework Submission (by Monday, July 13th)</a>

- A link to your project on github
- If you need a refresher on getting started with Git, check out [the cheat sheet](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/resources/git-started-cheat-sheet.md) I created.

####<a id="projectsubmission">Final Project Submission (by Thurs July 16)</a>

Submit your final project with the following items:

- A link to your final project hosted on github pages, in the form <yourUsername>.github.io/<yourRepositoryname>.  [This is how you get your site hosted on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/units/4-specialtopics.md#45a-hosting-with-github-pages).
- A link to your github repository
