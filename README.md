This summer, we will explore HTML and CSS, the markup languages that are the building blocks of the web, and responsive design techniques, which are critical in a world where much of the web is consumed on mobile devices.  You’ll learn by building real websites, from a landing page to a personal portfolio.  

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to create a website, and have a strong foundation to tackle more advanced web development.
