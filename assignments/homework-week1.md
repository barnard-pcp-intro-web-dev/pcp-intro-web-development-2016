####Practice:

**Project 1**: If you didn't finish in class, make sure you add additional content to your landing page.

Scenario: Your top choice for college loves that you can code and wants to see some of your work.  

Make the landing page you started in a previous lesson all about you.  Think about what you can include, and add content (see the next slide for details)!

What is your background?  What are your accomplishments? What are your hobbies?  What else are you proud of?

Add: 

- A header element containing an image element
- An input element for email submission (it won’t actually submit anything yet!)
- Content about you using at least 6 different elements.  For example, use <p> to introduce yourself
- Content reviews the following information about you:
	- Your name and picture
	- A little bit about who you are
	- Your contact details (Twitter handle, email, etc.)
	- Recent work
	- Your skills


**Optional Practice: Update Your Resume**

Is your resume still in a Word or PDF document somewhere? Pish-posh. You have the skills now to move it to the web!

- Create a new html document titled: resume.html.
- Choose to find your resume, create your dream resume, or google a stranger’s resume.
- Use HTML elements to recreate your chosen resume in your HTML document.
- Add yourself as author and any relevant keywords for the jobseeker.
- Use appropriate semantic HTML elements (e.g. footer, article, etc.) wherever you can.


####Reflect

- In your own words: what is html, and how does it contribute to a web application?
- In your own words: what is the DOM and why does it matter?
- What’s the most interesting thing you’ve learned so far?
- How confident are you feeling in your grasp of class material so far? Are there particular topics/areas in which you would like more help?
