###Due Monday, June 29th

####Review:

- Watch -  [HTML - Hamburger Text Markup Language](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/html/html) (3:35)

	- Answer the following:
		- What’s the difference between a block and an inline element in HTML? Give at least 3 examples of each. 
		- We build the structure of our websites using structural, semantic, elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc. How are structural elements displayed? What’s the advantage of using semantic HTML?

####Practice:

- **Project 1**: If you didn't finish in class, make sure you add additional content to your landing page.

> Scenario: Your top choice for college loves that you can code and wants to see some of your work. 
>
> Make the landing page you started in a previous lesson all about you.  Think about what you can include, and add content (see the next slide for details)!
>
> What is your background?  What are your accomplishments? What are your hobbies?  What else are you proud of?

> Add: 

> - A header element containing an image element
- An input element for email submission (it won’t actually submit anything yet!)
- Content about you using at least 6 different elements.  For example, use <p> to introduce yourself
- Content reviews the following information about you:
	- Your name and picture
	- A little bit about who you are
	- Your contact details (Twitter handle, email, etc.)
	- Recent work
	- Your skills

- **Optional Practice: Re-examine Webpage Structure**

> - Download [this simple incomplete webpage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2oPzQ6clzPRSEdxQWdkYW5INGM/view?usp=sharing)
- Open the page in Sublime Text 2.  You can do this by first finding where you downloaded the page on your computer (once it is downloaded off of Google Drive, don't download it again), then right-click and open using Sublime Text 2.  
- Also open this page in a browser. You can do this by dragging and dropping the file into your browser of choice or by right-clicking and opening using your browser software.
- What do you see?

- Next, between the <html> and <body> tags, include:
	- An opening <head> tag
	- An opening and closing <title> tag with the content “My first webpage!”
	- A closing </head> tag
	- Inside your <head>, add a <meta>* tag.
	- Inside your opening <meta> tag, add the following attributes:
		- name=”author”
		- content=”Your_Name_Here”
		- *Note: <meta> tags are self-closing and do not need a closing tag!
	- Open your page in the browser. How has your page changed?

- Next, add another <meta> tag to your <head> element. Give it the attributes name=”keywords” and content=”learn to code, codelift, first site”.

- Reflect
	- When you refresh the page with your new tags, what changes? What shows up on the page and what doesn’t?
	- Given these changes, what is the difference between the <head> and the <body>?
	- What’s the purpose of the <meta> element? (Do some research and find out!)


- **Optional Practice: Update Your Resume**

> Is your resume still in a Word or PDF document somewhere? Pish-posh. You have the skills now to move it to the web!

> - Create a new html document titled: resume.html.
- Choose to find your resume, create your dream resume, or google a stranger’s resume.
- Use HTML elements to recreate your chosen resume in your HTML document.
- Add yourself as author and any relevant keywords for the jobseeker.
- Use appropriate semantic HTML elements (e.g. footer, article, etc.) wherever you can.

> Don't forget: when you are done, upload it to your Google Drive folder!

- Look over the [list of additional resources for Unit 2A - Introduction to HTML](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/units/2A-introhtml.md#resources).  Read or watch any that cover information on which you need more practice or about which you would like to learn more.

####Reflect

Answer the following questions: 

- In your own words: what is html, and how does it contribute to a web application?
- In your own words: what is the DOM and why does it matter?
- What’s the most interesting thing you’ve learned so far?
- How confident are you feeling in your grasp of class material so far? Are there particular topics/areas in which you would like more help?
