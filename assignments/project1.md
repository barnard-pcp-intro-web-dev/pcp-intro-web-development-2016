##Part 1 - HTML 

####First step: directory structure

- Keep all the files for your site in the same directory/folder
HTML Files, CSS Files, Images, Scripts, etc.
- Create a directory and name it: landing
- Open the directory in Sublime Text

####Next, create your first HTML page

- Open a new page in Sublime Text
- Add structure: `<!DOCTYPE HTML>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
- Save it as index.html in your landing directory
- Open index.html in Chrome

####Add more content

- In the body section of your landing page, add a few sentences with some text about you.

####Add even more: tags, elements, and attributes

- Add:
	- Input element for email submission
	- A header element containing and image
	- 3-5 more elements with text about you.  

##Part 2 - CSS

####Create and link a stylesheet

- In Sublime, open a new file and save it in your directory as styles.css
- Add the following:

```css
body {
	text-align: center; 
}
```
- Add a link in the `<head>` of each HTML page to connect the stylesheet.

```
<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”styles.css”>
```

####Add more styling

- Add 
	- A background image to the body 
	- Header image:
		- use border-radius to get the rounded image effect
		- use height and width to resize the image (try starting with 200px)
	- 3-5 more CSS rules
