####Review:

- Watch - [Don’t Fear Starting From Scratch - Part 2 CSS](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/css/don%E2%80%99t-fear-starting-from-scratch-2) (11:03)

####Practice:

- Layout Drill - Left Hand Navigation (adapted from [DBC](www.devbootcamp.com))

We're going to learn some fundamentals about webpage layout. You'll have a HTML file to work with and your job is to change the CSS and only *some* of the CSS to achieve the desired layout.

Download [this folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2oPzQ6clzPRd2hGOWlxbTBnZjA&usp=sharing) which contains a basic HTML file (index.html) that models a block post, including:

- A page header
- A navigation bar
- The blog post content
- A footer

If you're not familiar with floating in CSS, you might need to take time to read these resources:

[A Step-by-Step Float Tutorial](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/)
[Simple 2 column CSS layout](http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/developing_with_web_standards/csslayout/2-col/)

CSS is fun and really powerful. It takes a bit to get a handle on selectors and their cascading interaction, but the engineers who master it are treated with awe and reverence.

The styles.css file is missing a few rules.  Specifically, it's missing `float`, `clear`, and padding properties for some selectors.  Modify the styles.css file by adding these properties so the blog post looks like the this:

![Blog post](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/787ea8fd6fa5beadb161d3275a64ef00b4762871/687474703a2f2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f336a30573351304d304f3258324e3136306a31332f53637265656e25323053686f74253230323031332d30322d31362532306174253230372e31322e3138253230504d2e706e67)

Don't change the CSS that is already on the styles.css file--just add `float`, `clear`, and padding properties as needed.  

The entire page is 720px wide; don't change that. The entire .content area should be 600px wide, including any padding and borders. The h2 which includes the blog post title should be flush against the top of the content area.

The left-hand navigation should be 120px wide including any padding and borders. The list items should not have any bullets and the navigation elements should be flush against the left-hand side of the page.

The footer text should align with the start of the content text and there should be 20px of space between the footer text and both the bottom of the content area and the bottom of the page.

- Create a Cheat Sheet.
	- For this assignment, you’ll create a cheat sheet for HTML/CSS.  Download and/or print this file: [HTML and CSS Cheat Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2oPzQ6clzPRdE9oU1ZxeHJUMTQ/view?usp=sharing), and fill it out completely. I recommend you print out a hard copy for yourself and/or save your cheat sheet somewhere easily accessible.


###By Monday, July 6th

####Review:

- **Review with a browser-based coding program**.  There are numerous browser-based programs (e.g., Codecademy, Dash) to learn how to code. While they are somewhat lacking as learning tools, they’re excellent for review. You will be going through Codecademy CSS as a refresher. To do the assignment:
	
	- Go to [http://www.codecademy.com/](http://www.codecademy.com/) and create an account 
	- Then, go to [http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
	- You will complete 3 lessons starting with Introduction to CSS. The lessons to complete are: (1) Introduction to CSS, (2) CSS Classes and IDs, (3) CSS Element Positioning (Note: you can start with the HTML lessons for additional review, but only the CSS ones are required)  
	- The last lesson is a project to build a resume. Do this lesson in codecademy, then: 
		- Create a new local directory called resume
		- Create two files: index.html and stylesheet.css and copy/paste the content from codecademy into those files
