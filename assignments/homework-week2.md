####Review:

- Watch - [Don’t Fear Starting From Scratch - Part 2 CSS](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/css/don%E2%80%99t-fear-starting-from-scratch-2) (11:03)

####Practice:

- Create a Cheat Sheet.
	- For this assignment, you’ll create a cheat sheet for HTML/CSS.  Download and/or print this file: [HTML and CSS Cheat Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1MYP7sU_C0vWng4Ml9ZelhQZWM/view), and fill it out completely. I recommend you print out a hard copy for yourself and/or save your cheat sheet somewhere easily accessible.
- Finish Project 1: Add additional CSS styling to your landing page.
	- Two images, one for the headshot and another for background
	- CSS rules
		- Add a background image
		- Header image:
			- use border-radius to get the rounded image effect
			- use height and width to resize the image (try starting with 200px)


###By Monday, July 6th

####Review:

- **Review with a browser-based coding program**.  There are numerous browser-based programs (e.g., Codecademy, Dash) to learn how to code. While they are somewhat lacking as learning tools, they’re excellent for review. You will be going through Codecademy CSS as a refresher. To do the assignment:
	
	- Go to [http://www.codecademy.com/](http://www.codecademy.com/) and create an account 
	- Then, go to [http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
	- You will complete 3 lessons starting with Introduction to CSS. The lessons to complete are: (1) Introduction to CSS, (2) CSS Classes and IDs, (3) CSS Element Positioning (Note: you can start with the HTML lessons for additional review, but only the CSS ones are required)  
	- The last lesson is a project to build a resume. Do this lesson in codecademy, then: 
		- Create a new local directory called resume
		- Create two files: index.html and stylesheet.css and copy/paste the content from codecademy into those files
