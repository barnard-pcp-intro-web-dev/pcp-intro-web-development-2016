#Project 2 - Build a 3-Page Website

For Project 2, you will create a 3-page website.

As the title suggests, your site should have at least three pages:

1. *index.html* - a basic about page (feel free to use elements from the landing page you created in Project 1)
2. *resume.html*  - a page that includes your resume (feel free to grab the one from the prior assignment) 
3. *gallery.html* - a page that includes at least 4 images which you have aligned using CSS. For example, [this page](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/xhtml-css-templates/decentgallery.jpg) or [this page](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/gal/minishowcase.jpg)


To begin this assignment, create a directory called mywebsite.

Your site should have the following characteristics:

- One shared CSS file which controls styling on all of your pages
- A shared navigation bar, and a shared footer 

In evaluating your work, I will be checking for:

- Directory structure: organize your code in a logical structure.  - is your code organized in a manner that is logical? You have seen many examples of appropriate directory structures in our work so far.  A good directory structure should be something like:
- Code quality: write valid HTML and CSS. The w3c consortium has an excellent [code validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) which tells you if your html page is valid.  There is also a [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Copy/paste or upload your files to the validator, and fix any errors! 
- Code readability: write code that is readable by using appropriate formatting (e.g., filenames and tags are all lowercase) and appropriate comments where applicable. Udacity has an excellent [style guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) which you should read/use for code readability.
