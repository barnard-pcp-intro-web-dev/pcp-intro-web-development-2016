#Project 2 - Build a 3-Page Website

For Project 2, you will create a 3-page website.  

Scenario: You are a freelance front-end web developer, and you have been asked by your favorite restaurant (or a completely new restaurant selling your favorite food) to make them a whole new website similar to the sample below.

##Part 1 - Directory Structure and Styling
As the title suggests, your site should have at least three pages:

1. *index.html* - a page that includes at least 3 images of food, names of the food, description of the food, and its cost--all of which you have aligned using CSS. For example, see image above or [this page](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/xhtml-css-templates/decentgallery.jpg) or [this page](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/gal/minishowcase.jpg)
2. *about.html*  - a basic about page (feel free to use elements from the landing page you created in Project 1)
3. *contact.html* - a page with the restaurant's contact information and input elements for name and email submission (so the user can sign up for the restaurant's mailing list)

**To begin this assignment**, use the Command Line to create a directory called restaurant-website.  In this directory, create the files: index.html, about.html, menu.html, and style.css.

**Before starting to code**, draw out the layout of your page using boxes (remember, [boxifying design](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CBYD9bsQmbMLX5sZINM4B6Bx5oFDcE64_jezmKzvHLQ/edit)?).  

**For starter code**, go to [http://jsbin.com/riyodamuqe/edit?html,css,output](http://jsbin.com/riyodamuqe/edit?html,css,output) and copy and paste the HTML into your index.html file and the CSS into your style.css file.

**Your site should have the following characteristics**:

- One shared CSS file which controls styling on all of your pages
- A shared header, navigation bar, and footer 

In evaluating your work, I will be checking for:

- Directory structure: organize your code in a logical structure.  - is your code organized in a manner that is logical? You have seen many examples of appropriate directory structures in our work so far.  A good directory structure should be something like:
- Code quality: write valid HTML and CSS. The w3c consortium has an excellent [code validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) which tells you if your html page is valid.  There is also a [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Copy/paste or upload your files to the validator, and fix any errors! 
- Code readability: write code that is readable by using appropriate formatting (e.g., filenames and tags are all lowercase) and appropriate comments where applicable. Udacity has an excellent [style guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) which you should read/use for code readability.

##Part 2 - Make it responsive

- Improve your website - use grid-based design, media queries, or flexible images.
