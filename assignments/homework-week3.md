####Practice:

- Complete steps 1-3 of the [Final Project](https://github.com/fma2/pcp-intro-web-development/blob/master/units/5-finalproject.md#51-finalproject):

	- Step 1: Choose a project: You have wide latitude in the type of website you build. Your website must include at least 4 pages, media, and use modern, valid HTML and CSS. You may choose to use a framework if you like. Some example frameworks include Bootstrap, Foundation, or Skeleton. If you’re not sure what to build, how about: 
		- A website for an organization, real or fictitious
		- A website for a person, real, historical, or fictitious
		- A website for an event or a cause
		- Redesign an existing website (for example, can you make a better yelp? This guy prototyped one)

	- Step 2: Create wireframes
		- Watch: What is a Wireframe?
		- Read: The 5 Steps of a Professional UX Design Process
		- Prepare your wireframes - paper is perfectly fine or you can use an online tool like Google Docs, Google Slides, or an official wireframing tool like balsamiq (don’t buy it, just use free trial!). I suggest you start out wireframing just 4 pages. You can always expand your site later, but start small. 

	- Step 3: Start Building! - Set up your pages 
		- Set up a local project directory, and make sure you put it under version control with git
		- Set up the shell of your HTML and CSS pages 
		- Push to github
